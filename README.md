**Ecommerce Database Design**
  This project involves designing and implementing a database for an e-commerce platform. The database handles customer information, orders, payments, and shipments.

**Key Features**
  **(1) Normalization:** The database is normalized to reduce redundancy and ensure efficient storage.
  **(2) Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** An ERD was created to visualize the structure, showing entities, attributes, and their relationships.
  **(3) Relational Schema:** The relational schema defines the tables, columns, data types, and relationships in the database.
  **(3) SQL Scripts and Output:** To validate relationships, SQL scripts and test data are provided.

**Database Structure**
The database includes the following tables:
  **(1) CUSTOMER:** Stores customer details.
  **(2) ADDRESS:** Manages customer addresses.
  **(3) CREDIT_LINE:** Tracks credit lines for customers.
  **(4) PRODUCT:** Contains product details.
  **(5) ORDERS:** Records customer orders.
  **(6) PAYMENT:** Manages payments.
  **(7) PAYMENT_METHOD:** Stores payment method details.
  **(8) SHIPMENT:** Tracks shipment information.

  To set up the database, run the following SQL script:
  
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS Ecommerce_DB;
    CREATE DATABASE Ecommerce_DB;
    USE Ecommerce_DB;
